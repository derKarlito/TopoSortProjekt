    <headline>Node</headline>
    <body>
      Here you can see a node (vertex). You can access it via the inventory on the left.
      There are 5 types of nodes:
      \t- water 
      \t- vegetation/plants 
      \t- atmosphere 
      \t- plate tectonics 
      \t- moon 
      Arranging nodes in certain combinations result in various changes to the planet. 
      To arrange the nodes, all you have to do is drag it by holding your left 
      mouse button in place inside the intended graph editor. 
      Once the nodes are arranged and connected with each other, 
      you will see the in-degree in the top right corner of the node.

      The inventory contains all available types of nodes to use 
      and build your own graph. You may use each node as often as you like. 
    
      To use a node from inventory, you simply have to 
      drag and drop it from your inventory into the 
      graph editor. To delete a node, just 
      drag it back in the inventory.

      The control panel of the algorithm has three functions:
      - Start/Pause the algorithm (play)
      - Go to the next step (arrow to the right)
      - Repeat the last step (arrow to the left)

      As soon as you build your graph, you are able to use the start button.
      Now the algorithm will run through your graph, starting with a node that
      has an indegree of 0, and build up your topologically sorted order.
      Each step will be displayed at the console.

      Note, if you want to repeat or skip one or multiple steps, the algorithm will
      stop automatically. In addition, the algorithm will be canceled as soon as another
      node is placed while the algorithm is running or paused.

    <headline>Graph editor</headline>
    <body>
      In this area you are able to build your own graph.
      To build your graph, you need to drag a few nodes from
      the inventory into the editor. Once this is done, you may
      connect them with each other with the right mouse button.
      To arrange your graph in a more structured way, you have 3 lines given.

      Be careful not to include any cycles in your graph!
      When you run the algorithm, the current node, which the
      algorithm is at and the node that will be visited are added to the output.
      Nodes that have already been visited and added to the output are also marked.

      The console displays you the current state of your planet.
      The planet gets updated with each step of the algorithm.
      Moreover, each step will be documented here.

      The topologically sorted order the nodes of your graph are in
      are documented during the alrorithm‘s runtime.

      Above the console, there are a few controls.
      Beside the buttons for controlling the audio output and starting/quitting the tutorial,
      you will find a glossary as well as a button to switch the language of the game.

    <headline>Dynamic planet</headline>
    <body>
      Right above the graph editor, you will find your planet, which will change its
      appearance in depending of your graph as the algorithm runs.
      Therefore, the order and quantity of your nodes does affect the appearance of your
      planet.

      In this way, the planet may change in its basic composition (lava planet, ocean planet, ...)
      as well as in its atmospheric properties (sandstorms, thin atmosphere, ...).
      Moreover, moons may also appear in the orbit of your planet.
